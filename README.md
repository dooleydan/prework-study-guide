# The Source of PSG Knowledge

## Description

Welcome, fellow coding novice. If you stumble across this prework study guide, hopefully it provides and points you in the right direction of completing your project or problem. This project was the first thrust in an initial leap of faith into learning the language of code. With this study guide and the help of a tutor it will allow you to learn the basics of CSS, GitHub, HTML, and JavaScript. Every project seems to get adjusted through the later modules, so there is a 92% chance this description will also be adjusted in the coming days.


## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
